I am Baalaji Balasubramani, a 22 year old, popularly known around the internet world as baalajimaestro.

I work on a lot of opensource projects, you can find them all on my GitHub!

I use Linux as a primary distro for over 4 years now.
My primary distro choices include Alpine (for servers), Arch (for desktops).

I am currently running Debian Bullseye on an OrangePi 3 (ARM64)

And yes, that is my primary development system too. I connect to Codespaces incase I desire to code anything that needs high amount of resources (Rust)

GitHub Codespaces is a really good environment that is helping me do stuff even when I dont own a full-fledged PC.

For programming, I use Rust or Python as my primary choice. I can also code in C, C++, Java, Javascript, PHP.
I am looking forward to learning Go.
I use Bash Scripting to automate all tasks. Like even deploying this website.

I code all stuff with VSCode! No IDE specific for any language.
I love to work with Docker and Kubernetes clusters. I have created a few [Docker Images](https://hub.docker.com/u/baalajimaestro), newer ones are on Gitlab (blame Docker for ratelimiting pulls) respective repos, for my own personal use.

My repos are currently split across sourcehut/gitlab/github. In increasing order of age.

I am a person who feels music is a drug. Feel free to suggest me some nice music if you have some.

It's hard to see me without writing or thinking about code, even if you happen to do so, I would have been sleeping or gaming!

If you ﬁnd some­one with the user­name `baalajimaestro` on any platform, you can be mostly sure its me

I am currently working at TheCareerLabs as a DevOps Engineer
